Configuration values are loaded through `quiz_automation.config.Settings`.
Screen-region defaults used by `run.py` can be overridden by setting
environment variables before executing the tests. Provide values as
comma-separated lists. For example:

```
export QUIZ_REGION="100,100,600,400"
export CHAT_BOX="800,900"
export RESPONSE_REGION="100,550,600,150"
export OPTION_BASE="100,520"
```

The defaults defined in `Settings` are used when these variables are absent.
