# Basic AI Auto Assistant

Utilities for automating multiple choice quizzes.

## Command line usage

After installation the project exposes a `quiz-automation` command.

```bash
# Start with a small stats window
quiz-automation --mode gui

# Run without any GUI components
quiz-automation --mode headless
```

The same interface is available by executing the script directly:

```bash
python run.py --mode gui
```
